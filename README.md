### **Research Question 1:**
What are the key factors and trends that enable countries to transition from one level of
development to the next, and how do these factors sustain their status within a particular
development level?

**Description:**
In this analysis, countries will be categorized into three distinct levels of development:
developed, developing, and underdeveloped. The study will focus on identifying the patterns
and trends that emerge as nations progress from one level to the next, pinpointing the key
changes that drive these transitions. Using selected countries as case studies, predictions will
be made regarding potential shifts between development levels.
As part of the analysis, trends from countries that have successfully transitioned to a higher
development level will be compared with those of countries that have yet to achieve such
progress. This comparison will help identify similarities and predict the key factors necessary
for transition. Additionally, the research will examine the most influential factors, uncover the
interdependencies among these factors, and determine the critical elements that sustain a
country's status within a particular development level.

### **Research Question 2:**
How do educational attainment, access to lifelong learning opportunities, and labor market
characteristics influence an individual's ability to achieve high income in a developed
economy?

**Description:**
This research delves into the intricate relationship between education, lifelong learning, and
labor market dynamics to understand their impact on individual income levels in developed
economies. By analyzing data on educational attainment, participation in lifelong learning
programs, unemployment rates, job quality, and earnings, the study aims to identify how these
factors contribute to income inequality and social mobility. Through a combination of
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we aim to develop predictive models that estimate the
likelihood of individuals achieving high incomes based on their educational background,
involvement in lifelong learning, and labor market characteristics. Additionally, the research
will explore how different levels of education, from primary to tertiary, influence individuals'
earning potential and career progression, while examining the role of lifelong learning in
enhancing skills and knowledge to improve employment opportunities and wages.

### **Research Question 3:**
How does healthcare expenditure impact life expectancy and poverty reduction in lowermiddle-income countries, and what investment levels can break the cycle of poor health and
economic hardship for sustainable development?

**Description:**
In this analysis, lower-middle-income countries will be examined to understand how healthcare
expenditure influences life expectancy and poverty reduction. The study will focus on
identifying the patterns and trends that emerge from variations in healthcare spending,
exploring how different investment levels contribute to breaking the cycle of poor health and
economic hardship. By analyzing historical data and trends, the research will determine the
critical investment thresholds that promote sustainable development. We will also compare
countries with varying levels of healthcare investment to identify key factors that lead to
improved health outcomes and economic stability, providing insights for future policy
decisions.
